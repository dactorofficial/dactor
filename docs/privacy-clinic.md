## 1. Introduction & Scope

Welcome to **Dactor** ("Dactor", "we", "us", or "our"), an administrative outpatient department (OPD) queue intelligence, appointment scheduling, and diagnostic laboratory orchestration platform operated in Nepal.

This **Clinic & Healthcare Provider Privacy Policy** governs the collection, processing, storage, and protection of personal and institutional information provided by:
- Healthcare facilities (clinics, polyclinics, hospitals, diagnostic pathology centers, and imaging facilities);
- Medical practitioners and consulting doctors registered with the Nepal Medical Council (NMC);
- Clinic administrators, reception desk operators, laboratory technicians, and authorized staff members.

Dactor provides administrative software infrastructure that connects clinics and doctors with patients. In this ecosystem, **the healthcare facility operates as an independent Data Controller / Fiduciary** with respect to the medical records of its patients, while **Dactor operates as a secure Data Processor / Technology Infrastructure Provider**.

If you are a patient or guardian seeking the Patient Privacy Policy, please refer to our [Dactor Patient & Guardian Privacy Policy](privacy-patient.md) (Live: [https://dactorofficial.github.io/privacy-patient.html](https://dactorofficial.github.io/privacy-patient.html)).

## 2. Information We Collect from Clinics & Healthcare Providers

To register, verify, and operate healthcare facilities and attending practitioners on Dactor, we collect the following categories of data:

### 2.1 Clinic & Facility Institutional Information
- **Facility Profile:** Clinic/hospital registered name, physical address, GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) for patient discovery on OpenStreetMap, municipality, ward number, and province.

## 3. Patient Information Handled by Clinics via Dactor

While using Dactor, clinics and practitioners handle confidential patient data. Dactor provides encrypted tools for managing these workflows:

1. **OPD Queue & Token Records:** Assigned 10-digit tracking codes, queue token numbers, scheduled consultation time windows, and patient status (`waiting`, `in_consultation`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `no_show`).
2. **Consultation & Clinical Notes:** Optional attending doctor clinical summaries, diagnosis notes, follow-up recommendations, and digital prescriptions entered into the consultation desk.
3. **Walk-In Registrations:** When clinic reception staff register walk-in patients directly at the desk, the staff inputs the patient's name, mobile number, age, gender, and doctor choice with patient verbal consent.
4. **Diagnostic Requisitions & Statuses:** 3-stage laboratory pipeline tracking: (1) Sample Collected, (2) Processing in Lab, and (3) Prepared & Uploaded.
5. **Billing Invoices & Ledgers:** Itemized consultation charges, lab investigation fees, discount records, payment gateway receipts (eSewa / fonepay / cash at desk), and invoice timestamps.

## 4. Purpose of Data Processing & Operational Workflows

Dactor processes provider and associated patient data strictly for legitimate healthcare administrative and technical operations:

- **OPD Queue Coordination:** Synchronizing live token calling, displaying estimated arrival windows, and minimizing physical crowding in clinic waiting rooms.
- **Doctor Physical Presence Indicator:** Accurately reflecting whether an attending doctor is physically "In Cabin" or "Away" so patients are truthfully informed.
- **Early Arrival Notifications:** Providing an opt-in workflow where clinic staff can send high-priority push notifications to patients who explicitly agreed to early calls when a doctor is ahead of schedule.
- **3-Stage Lab Delivery:** Enabling certified lab technicians to upload verified pathology reports and ensuring delivery to the correct patient via identity verification gates.
- **Billing & Legal Receipts:** Generating electronic payment receipts and tracking revenue settlements in accordance with Nepal financial and tax regulations.
- **Fraud Prevention & Audit Trails:** Logging critical actions (such as token cancellations, refund authorizations, and diagnostic report uploads) to maintain institutional accountability.

## 5. Doctor-Patient Confidentiality & Nepal Legal Compliance

Healthcare providers using Dactor agree to adhere to the strictest standards of patient confidentiality:

### 5.1 Nepal Individual Privacy Act 2075 (2018) & Privacy Rules 2077
Under Section 3 and Section 28 of the Individual Privacy Act 2075, **health data is classified as sensitive personal data**. Healthcare providers must maintain total confidentiality. Dactor enforces technical safeguards, but clinics and doctors bear the legal duty under Nepal law never to disclose patient information without explicit consent or judicial order.

### 5.2 Nepal Medical Council (NMC) Code of Ethics
Doctors utilizing Dactor must uphold the NMC Code of Medical Ethics (2017). Attending doctors are solely responsible for their clinical evaluations, diagnostic interpretations, and treatment plans. Dactor is a communication and management medium and does not engage in the practice of medicine.

### 5.3 Electronic Transactions Act 2063 (2008)
Digital appointment tokens, electronic invoices, and electronic signatures generated through Dactor hold legal validity as electronic records pursuant to Nepal's Electronic Transactions Act 2063.

## 6. Data Security, Storage & Architecture

We employ defense-in-depth security measures to protect healthcare information:

- **Encryption in Transit:** All communications between mobile applications, web portals, and server infrastructure are encrypted using modern Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3).
- **Encryption at Rest:** All sensitive personal and institutional records stored in the cloud database are encrypted at rest with industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Strict multi-tenant PostgreSQL Row-Level Security policies ensure that staff from Clinic A can never view, query, or leak records belonging to Clinic B.
- **Private Diagnostic Storage Buckets:** Uploaded medical documents (lab reports, scans) are stored in private, unguessable storage buckets protected by short-lived, time-limited cryptographic signed URLs. Public directory listing is strictly disabled.
- **Local SQLite Encrypted Ledger & Offline Sync:** The Clinic Android app utilizes an isolated local SQLite database for uninterrupted desk operations during network volatility, synchronizing back to the cloud ledger via atomic transactions.

---

## 7. Third-Party Integrations & Absolute "Zero Data Selling" Policy

**Dactor maintains an absolute Zero-Sale policy.** We do NOT sell, rent, monetize, broker, or trade personal data, practitioner credentials, or patient health information to third parties, advertisers, pharmaceutical marketing groups, or insurance aggregators.

We only integrate with authorized third-party infrastructure providers necessary to deliver platform functions:
- **Cloud Database & Storage (Supabase / AWS):** Isolated hosting with RLS policy enforcement.
- **Push Notification Infrastructure (Firebase Cloud Messaging - Google LLC):** Delivering instant priority queue token alerts and doctor-in-cabin updates to mobile devices.
- **Geographic Mapping (OpenStreetMap & MapLibre):** Displaying open-source geographic clinic pins without tracking user personal browsing habits.
- **Nepal Payment Processors (eSewa / Digital Wallets):** Processing licensed financial transactions under Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) digital payment bylaws. No credit card or wallet PINs are ever stored by Dactor.
